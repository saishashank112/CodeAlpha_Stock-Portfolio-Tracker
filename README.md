# ðŸ“Š Stock Portfolio Tracker

A minimalist Python-based stock portfolio tracker that calculates total investment value from user-defined stock quantities and hardcoded prices.

## ðŸš€ Why This Exists

This project strips tracking to its essence â€” no APIs, no bloat â€” just core logic to teach or prototype fast. Think of it as a launchpad for:

- Learning Python fundamentals (dictionaries, input/output, file handling)
- Rapid prototyping financial tools
- Extending toward real-time, API-integrated systems

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Input any stock + quantity
- Hardcoded price dictionary for instant value calculation
- CSV export for quick data capture
- Built for expansion (e.g., real-time APIs, visual dashboards)

## ðŸ§  Core Concepts Used

- Python Dictionaries
- Loops and Input Handling
- Arithmetic Operations
- File I/O (CSV writing)

## ðŸ“¦ Usage

1. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python stock_tracker.py
